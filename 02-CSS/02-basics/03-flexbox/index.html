       <h3>What is FlexBox??</h3>
       <p>The flex property sets the flexible length on flexible items. If the element is not a flexible item, the flex property has no effect.
           It is flexible box and we can do anything with it .CSS Flexbox, short for Flexible Box Layout, offers a streamlined way to design adaptable and visually appealing layouts. It works primarily in one dimension (row or column) to intelligently distribute space among elements within a container
        </p>
        <h3>The flex item properties are:</h3>
        <Ul>
            <li>order flex</li>
         <li>   flex-grow</li>
        <li>flex-shrink</li>
        
          <li>  flex-basis</li>
       
        </Ul>
        <div class="flexbox1">
        <div class="div1 div">
            <h4>Order Flexbox</h4>
            <p>Flex-order is a property that allows you to manipulate the default source order of the items within a flex container. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div2 div">
            
            <h4>Grow Flex</h4>
            <p>The flex-grow property in CSS controls the proportional growth of an element within a flex container. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div3 div">
            <h4>Flex Shrink</h4>
            <p>The flex-shrink property specifies how the item will shrink relative to the rest of the flexible items inside the same container. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="div4 div">
            <h4>Flex Basis</h4>
            <p>Flex-basis is a CSS property used in flexboxes that sets the initial size of a flex item before it grows or shrinks.  </p>
        </div>

    <h3>Typical use cases of flexbox:</h3>
    <h3>Navigation:</h3>
    <p>A common pattern for navigation is to have a list of items displayed as a horizontal bar. This pattern, as basic as it seems, was difficult to achieve before flexbox. It forms the most simple of flexbox examples, and could be considered the ideal flexbox use case.</p>

    <h3> Split Navigation:</h3>
    <p>Another way to align items on the main axis is to use auto margins. This enables the design pattern of a navigation bar where one group of items are aligned left and another group aligned right.</p>

    <h3> Center item:</h3>
    <p>Before flexbox, developers would joke that the hardest problem in web design was vertical centering. This has now been made straightforward using the alignment properties in flexbox, as the following live example shows.</p>

    <h3>Media objects:</h3>
    <p>The media object is a common pattern in web design — this pattern has an image or other element to one side and text to the right. Ideally a media object should be able to be flipped — moving the image from left to right.</p>
